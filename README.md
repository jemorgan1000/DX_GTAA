## Objective
Ticket sales are a major revenue source for sports franchises. Often ticket sales are not data driven. We wanted to show how ticket sales can be forecasted

## Approach
1. Build a foundation - While data analysis is important, we first prioritized building a robust pipeline because it provides the flexibility to create better models down the road. 
2. Modeling - Throughing random algorithms at a data set is easy. Using the data to build a correct model that provides a insight is hard and creates value.
3. Test and Iterate - Every step we employeed was driven by the goal of improving prediction. We believe in testing often and failing fast, so we can create value faster.
